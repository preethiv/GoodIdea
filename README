/********************************

** DavisSouce site devlop
**
*********************************/

This directory includes:

 - Pressflow core
 - all the necessary contributed modules and themes in the sites/all dir
 - image files for the current development content
 - the sites/files/imagecache directory, with just a .gitignore file, which ignores all the folders in that dir
 - a root .gitignore file
 - a copy of the database dump which can be used with the current versions of the files
 - a custom script, at scripts/custom/gitc, which I use for each commit instead of 'git commit'

/******************
** Installation
*******************/

To install:
 - get all files from github repo
 - add a working settings.php 
 - One way to do this is install a dummy site in another directory, then copy that settings.php to this site, then delete the dummy site
 - Have a database set up and configured in the settings.php file
 - Import the database dump located in drupaldb.sql to the database
 - That's it. Should work.

/*************************
** Commiting to the repo
**************************/

Each commit to the repo should represent a complete version of the site which can be reverted to. 
Therefore, for each commit to the repo, make sure that:

 - stage all files that need to be staged
 - clear all caches (drush cc all)
 - new db dump to drupaldb.sql

You can use my script at scripts/custom/gitc to automate this, so that you don't need to remember every commit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The commit script:

Usage is: gitc [-p] “message”
message is required for now
This script:
 - clears all caches
 - dumps db to the appropriate place
 - shows the current git status, and waits for confirmation to continue
 - makes the commit with the message given. Uses the -a option! All tracked files will be staged!
 - if -p was specified, it also pushes changes to the remote site
